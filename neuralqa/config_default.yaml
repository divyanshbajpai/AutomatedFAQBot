  - question: "what is the goal of the fourth amendment?"
    context:
      The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that the right of
      the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
      unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall
      issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
      describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'The
      ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people’s right to privacy and freedom
      from unreasonable intrusions by the government. However, the Fourth Amendment
      does not guarantee protection from all searches and seizures, but only those done
      by the government and deemed unreasonable under the law.
