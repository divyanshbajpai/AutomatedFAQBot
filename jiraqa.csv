If you want to delete the initial PPMS assignment and the assignment is linked to other deliveries as well, the system will not allow this because it does not know which milestones to synchronize back to PPMS.

Deletion of initial PPMS assignment,
Why I cannot delete the initial PPMS assignment,
"Does it bring any side effect, if I rename PV/SCV, when they have been linked to Sirius and used in Sirius tasks?","Technically there is no side effect. 😊 
The link in Sirius is just based on the ID of the PPMS object and therefore a renaming does not matter, but it can take about two hours until the new name is reflected in Sirius. Unfortunately this renaming does not happen for the Release Indicators in the task list. Here the old name will stay. But, if it is necessary to have the new name here as well, you can just delete the indicators and recreate them again.

The structure elements from the cProjects program project need to be created manually in Sirius. In addition to that the old structure elements must be set to completed in the cProjects program project. All development projects need to be assigned to the new structure elements from Sirius.
What happens if a linked product version has a different Beta/RTC or GA date in Sirius?,"All assigned PPMS objects of one delivery must have the same Beta, RTC & GA dates. If this is not the case you haveto create a new delivery.
The Beta, RTC and GA date is written back to PPMS automatically for all connected product versions and these are only maintained in Sirius. In PPMS these dates are read-only.
