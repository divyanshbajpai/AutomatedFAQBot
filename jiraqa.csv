What happens if a linked product version has a different Beta/RTC or GA date in Sirius?,"All assigned PPMS objects of one delivery must have the same Beta, RTC & GA dates. If this is not the case you haveto create a new delivery.
The Beta, RTC and GA date is written back to PPMS automatically for all connected product versions and these are only maintained in Sirius. In PPMS these dates are read-only.

Some threats are not imported while using the import wizard,
"While importing threat modeling from an excel, the title of my threat is not filled",Threat titles are auto generated from SEC codes that define Product Standard Security. Some threats in the excel template are not associated with a product standard security but rather only with SecOps (Secure Operations Requirements). Threats associated only with SecOps will not have a title and hence the wizard will ask you to fill incomplete fields.
My threat model which I imported form an excel has not name,
Importing threat modeling from an excel fails,This happens when there are custom attack surface questions or custom threat categories are added to the excel.
